# Introduction to Typescript

## Typescript misconceptions :anguished:

    - Typescript is like C# ... Nope
    - Typescript is like Java ... Nope
    - Typescript makes you write Classes/ OO Code ... Nope. You can if you want. Some times it makes sense.

## What is Typescript ? :thinking:

> Sales Pitch: Typescript is a superset of Javascript

    - Typescript extends Javascript to make it safer
    - Add constraints to your javascript code that can be checked at build time
    - Forces developers to be more explicit about the intent without losing the flexibility of Javascript language
    - You do not have to know all of TS to reap benefits of the language
    - If TS is a superset of JS and JS's internal typesystem is closer to a language like OCaml. It only makes sense that TS's typesystem is like OCaml / Structural typing

## Relevant Notes

    - TS support in `mongoose` and `lodash` is horrendous. Use typegoose and Ramdajs
    - TS support in `React` is great. Nothing to worry here
    - TS support for `GraphQL` server libraries is very good. 
    - TS support for `express` is very good but the type system is not for the faint hearted

## Alternatives to TS :v:

### ReasonML :ok_hand:
    - https://reasonml.github.io/
    - Closer to OCaml but syntax is more JS like
    - Superior Type coverage than TS
    - First version of React was written in Reason
    - Smaller community
    - Insane fast transpilation

### Flow Type :broken_heart:
    - https://flow.org/
    - Facebook started it, now in community hands
    - Not as actively developed
    - Decent developer tooling
    - Low adoption by the community
    - Slowest transpilation of all
